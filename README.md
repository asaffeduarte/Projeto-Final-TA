The project phases are:
- Data Analysis and Cleaning: this phase evaluates the entire dataset and cleans possible errors in it
- Initial Training and Assessment: evaluate different models and test different metrics
- Optmized Training: choose the best model with the requirements described. Here, hyperparameters were changed, interesting features were chosen and other techniques were carried out that will help in choosing the best model
- Report writing
